# Personal Website with Vue.js

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal website project using Vue.js! This website features an "About Me" page where I share a bit about myself, and a "Projects" page showcasing my portfolio of work. The website is built using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

## Features

- **About Me Page**: Get to know me, my background, interests, and skills.
- **Projects Page**: Explore my portfolio with detailed descriptions of each project.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Vue.js Ecosystem**: Utilizes Vue Router for navigation and Vuex for state management (if applicable).
